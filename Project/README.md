This was an independent Final Project done in a group of 4 people including me, Jon, Janika and Elizabeth. We chose to analyze a dataset from a published paper. We chose to find important features using various models to see which one can best predict survival of heart failure and also we wanted to check which feature would be a better predictor for time to the death event.
